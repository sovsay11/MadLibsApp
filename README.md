<h1 align="center">Mad Libs App</h1>

<!--About The Project-->
## About The Project
This is a C# Xamarin app that creates a Mad Lib from a collection of provided words. A Mad Lib is a short story (usually silly) that takes words provided by a user and then inserts them into a prewritten story. The provided words can be adjectives, nouns, verbs, and so on.

Some of the Mad Libs used in this app are based on or come from Mad Libs written by Steve Hanson. You can visit his site in the "Resources" section below.

### Built With
<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Xamarin</li>
  <li>.NET</li>
  <li>Visual Studio</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started
IMO, the most straightforward way to get a local copy of this set up is to have VS already installed on your machine. Download a zipped copy of this code by going to the "<> Code" tab and expanding the green code button near the top right. Then press "Download Zip".

Once that is done, unzip the folder and open the project in VS by launching the solution file.

### Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>
    Install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio<a> (any version will work)
  </li>
    <li>A mobile device running Android (tablet, phone, etc.)</li>
</ul>

### Installation
If you want to clone this repository for future use instead of downloading the zipped folder, you can do so by running the following command(s) in Git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sovsay11/MadLibsApp.git
```
    

## Usage
This app was created to showcase various features of Xamarin.Forms in a mobile app environment. Specifically, this app demonstrates the use of entries, labels, and C# to create a simple Mad Lib generator for an Android device.
